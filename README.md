# 📝 To-Do Lister — A Simple CLI Task Tracker in Python

Because remembering stuff is hard, okay?
Hey there 👋
Welcome to To-Do Lister — a minimalist, command-line to-do list built in Python, powered by caffeine, a messy desktop, and the eternal struggle of "What was I supposed to do again?"

No databases, no weird dependencies — just Python and your brain doing its thing.

## 🚀 How It Works

This to-do list app does three things, and it does them well:

📋 View your tasks

➕ Add new tasks

❌ Delete tasks you’ve completed 

Your tasks are saved to a file called todolister.txt, so they stick around even after you close the program


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ Setup
Step 1: Git clone 
```
git clone https://github.com/Code1nception/ToDoList_Python.git
cd ToDoList_Python
```
Step 2: Run the File 
```
python ToDoLister.py
```
## 🛠️ Usage

Once you're running it, you'll see a simple menu:
```
-----TO-DO-LIST----
1. VIEW THE LIST
2. ADD THE ITEMS
3. DELETE THE ITEM
4. QUIT :)
```

⦁ Choose 1 to see your current tasks

⦁ Choose 2 to start adding tasks

⦁ Choose 3 to delete a task by its number

⦁ Choose 4 to exit 👋
